1. Pick any listed stock that you like ( the company should be listed for atleast 10+ years). Using investpy, extract its 11 year closing values - From Jan 2010 to Dec 2020.

2. Get the date and closing value - rest of the data is not required

3. Sort the dataset on date time and filter “Date” and “Close” columns

4. Plot and visualize the data with any library like matplotlib.pyplot



Build Prediction model

5. Build LSTM(Long Short-Term Memory network) model for prediction
Train LSTM model with data upto 31 Dec 2019 and predict the stock price for 2020.

6. Plot the predicted stock price with actual stock price
